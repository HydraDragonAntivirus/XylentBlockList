# XylentBlockList
 Xylent Block List For Internet To Avoid Bad Websites (Malware, Botnet, Phishing, Scam, Spam, Fraud, Tracking, IP Logger etc.)
 Sorry for not restoring ipv6 before
 There tracking cookie website from google detected by HitmanPro you can remove manually
 There too many false positives in list and you can manually report them for whitelist look the xylent.sourceforge.io
 whitelist is not updated
 7% of internet websites are infected once
 There 16 million known malicous websites on internet and 124 million are unknown
 https://www.securityweek.com/185-million-websites-infected-malware-any-time/
 It's t 2018 and says 1% is infected with 18 million websites but I'm 16 million
There over than 2 billion websites in the internet and there still some websites need to discovered with malware
Google detected 3 million only https://www.sikich.com/insight/how-to-detect-a-malicious-website/
Only twenty percent websites active right now. So there 28 million active websites and according to maravento only 50% websites are active in my database. https://gitlab.com/maravento/dev So there 8 million malicous active websites and there 28 million active websites and 20 million unkown malicious active websites here so detection rate is 28.57% but it probably more higher because I just calculated worst scenario but there also false positive ones so maybe it's really 28.57% percent. Edit: it maybe worser because I find more bigger closed database https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/internet-threats-late-2022/#:~:text=Indicators%20of%20Compromise-,Internet%20Threat%20Landscape,half%20of%202022%20(H1) but in praxis they test only most popular websites so maybe detection rate is so high
